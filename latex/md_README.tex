\section*{Overview}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\itshape wf} ({\itshape word frequency}) program counts the number of words in a file or input stream. The twenty most frequent words are displayed.
\item The {\itshape wf} program takes zero or one command line arguments. If zero command line arguments are provided the program input is taken from the {\itshape standard input} stream. If one command line argument is provided this must be a readable file, the contents of which will be used as the input.
\item Any data input must be successfully processed even if it is not A\+S\+C\+II data.
\item The word frequency output will be to the {\itshape standard output} stream.
\item Each record of output will be on a single line. The first field of the output line will be the frequency for the given word. The second field of the output line will be the given word.
\item A word is defined as containing one or more letter from the character set {\itshape \mbox{[}a-\/z\+A-\/Z\mbox{]}}. Note that ligatures are not included for words.
\item Output records will be displayed starting with the most frequent word and terminating with the twentieth most frequent word. If two words have the same frequency the records will be display in reverse lexicographical order of the word.
\item Any character {\itshape not} within the character set {\itshape \mbox{[}a-\/z\+A-\/Z\mbox{]}} as well as the end of input delimits a word.
\item Frequencies are determined based on case independence. For example \char`\"{}\+Hello\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}hello\char`\"{} are considered equivalent.

\section*{Shell Equivalent Command \mbox{\hyperlink{structJob}{Job}}}

The {\itshape wf} program produces equivalent output to the following {\itshape U\+N$\ast$X} command line job. Note that {\itshape wf.\+sh} is included in the scripts directory and is shown in the command documented below. {\itshape G\+NU} and {\itshape B\+SD} flavors of the below commands have slight differences. Please note that whitespace output by the shell command below will be different between {\itshape G\+NU} and {\itshape B\+SD}. 




\begin{DoxyCode}
#! /usr/bin/env sh

cat $1 \(\backslash\)
    | tr -cs 'a-zA-Z' '[\(\backslash\)n*]' \(\backslash\)
    | grep -v '^$' \(\backslash\)
    | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'\(\backslash\)
    | sort \(\backslash\)
    | uniq -c \(\backslash\)
    | sort -nr \(\backslash\)
    | head -20

exit $?
\end{DoxyCode}
 



\section*{Usage}

\subsection*{Example}

The following demonstrates executing the {\itshape wf} program with the word \char`\"{}hello\char`\"{} repeated three times as input with different cases. The output is a single record reporting that \char`\"{}hello\char`\"{} has a frequency of three within the input stream. 




\begin{DoxyCode}
$ echo "HELLO Hello hello" | wf
      3 hello
\end{DoxyCode}
