 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Entry point for the word frequency (wf) program; This module coordinates
 * the child processes which perform filting of the input as wel as the word
 * frequency analysis
 *
 * Any catastrophic error conditions are handled by calling assert() and
 * terminating the process;  In these situations memory will not be freed
 * and file descriptors will not be closed; This is acceptable since the
 * operating system will clean up upon process termination
